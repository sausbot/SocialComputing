    "The experiment:\n",
    "I implemented an experiment to search a job board website called Indeed and treat it with (A) being logged in using my resume data compared to (B) an anonymous user with no data. My resume includes 2 internships in various engineering roles and full time work for 1.5 years doing a software related job, totalling to 3 years of experience. I parsed the results and compared the data, looking at the average yearly salary range, hourly salary range and postings with no salary listed. The search critera was for \"Software Engineer\" jobs and the location was set to my browser location of Richmond Hill, ON (my hometown).\n",
    "\n",
    "The results:\n",
    "When logged in, the average salary I recieved was higher by around $6,000 and the hourly salary range was higher by around $6. There was only one posting shown in the first 15 results that had no salary data, compared to 5 postings for an anonymous user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The not logged in results contain postings for jr and intern software engineer, which could be because my hometown is an area with a lot of schools, and near some universities, so the average user is probably searching for internships. Whereas the postings I recieved did not include these results. The results I received also had more applied software positions relating to my past positions such as \"Robotics\" whereas without personalization this didn't show up. There are some results which are the same in both cases such as \"Interactive Sports Technologies Inc\". This is interesting because there is nothing on my resume that indicates I am interested in sports. Perhaps this shows how sponsored content might come into play with job listings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further Ideas:\n",
    "A wider scale experiment with checking more postings would provide better insight into the data as opposed to looking at 15 postings. \n",
    "\n",
    "It would also be interesting to see if I changed details in my resume such as my name (to a male name) or age (to be older), to see if that made a difference in the search results."
